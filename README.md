# Kazakh-chatbot
Simple chatbot based on Feed Forward Neural Network.

Our main contribution was about creating unique kazakh language NLP tools, so the bot can work with our letters and words. Still it needs lots of improvements, but as a start it is great.

The PDF document contains most of information if needed. You can see a little part of how bot works at the end of the installation video here: https://drive.google.com/file/d/11JasMdrLAh0hJ1W_hB-vdB99OTAwwb-0/view?usp=sharing

Make kazakh language great again.
