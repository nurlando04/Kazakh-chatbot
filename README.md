# Kazakh-chatbot
Some of the training model features of this chatbot was copied from https://github.com/python-engineer/pytorch-chatbot

Our main contribution was about creating unique kazakh language NLP tools, so the bot can work with our letters and words. Still it needs lots of improvements, but as a start it is great.

The PDF document contains most of information if needed. You can see a little part of how bot works in the end of the installation video here: https://drive.google.com/file/d/11JasMdrLAh0hJ1W_hB-vdB99OTAwwb-0/view?usp=sharing

Make kazakh language great again.
